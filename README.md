## Contribution
Created html and CSS files to create personal profile.  Includes picture of myself, about me section, work I've done and a contact me section.  As requested, the first image/link of a website created is larger than the other projects.  As I've only completed 3 projects including this one, the remaining images are simply placeholders.
